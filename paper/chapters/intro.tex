\section{The Finite Volume Method}%
\label{sub:The Finite Volume Method}
In the finite volume formulation we subdivide the spatial domain to a finite
number of volumes (or cells).
In one spatial dimension, these are intervals on the real line. We denote the
\(i\)-th grid cell by
\[
\Omega_i = (x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}),
\]
with length \(\Delta x = x_{i+1/2} - x_{i-1/2}\).

The method is derived directly from the integral form of the conservation law
for a quantity \(u(x,t)\). Unlike finite difference methods, which approximate
point-values at nodes, finite volume methods keep track of changes of the cell
averages of the solution. Considering a time interval \([t^n, t^{n+1}]\), the
change of the quantity within cell \(\Omega_i\) is determined entirely by the
flux \(f(u)\) across the cell boundaries:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:claw_int}
    \int\limits_{\Omega_i} u(x,t^{n+1}) \,\mathrm{d}x - \int\limits_{\Omega_i} u(x,t^{n}) \,\mathrm{d}x = 
    \int\limits_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}} f(u(x_{i-1/2},t)) \,\mathrm{d}t - \int\limits_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}} f(u(x_{i+1/2},t)) \,\mathrm{d}t.
\end{equation}

Our numerical goal is to determine the average value of \(u\) at the new time level \(t^{n+1}\), given the state at \(t^n\). We denote the numerical approximation to the cell average by \(u_i^n\):
\[
    u_i^n \approx \frac{1}{\Delta x} \int\limits_{\Omega_i} u(x,t^n) \,\mathrm{d}x.
\]

Similarly, we introduce a numerical flux \(F_{i+1/2}\) to approximate the time-averaged physical flux across the interface:
\[
    F_{i+1/2} \approx \frac{1}{\Delta t} \int\limits_{t^{n}}^{t^{n+1}} f(u(x_{i+1/2},t)) \,\mathrm{d}t,
\]
where \(\Delta t = t^{n+1} - t^n\).

Substituting these approximations into the integral conservation law \eqref{eq:claw_int} yields the fundamental discrete update formula:
\[
    (u_i^{n+1} - u_i^{n}) \Delta x = (F_{i-1/2} - F_{i+1/2}) \Delta t.
\]

Rearranging terms, we obtain the cell average at the next time step:
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:fvm_general}
    u_i^{n+1} = u_i^{n} - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} \left( F_{i+1/2} - F_{i-1/2} \right).
\end{equation}
