\section{Explicit}%
\label{sec:Explicit}
The formulation in this chapter primarily follows the algorithms
established by LeVeque \cite{1985_LeVeque_CONF}, \cite{1992_LeVeque_BOOK}, \cite{2002_LeVeque_BOOK},
and Van Leer \cite{1977_VanLeer}.

We restrict our discussion to the linear advection equation
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linadv}
    u_t + a u_x = 0, \quad x \in \mathbb{R}, \; t > 0,
\end{equation}
for a scalar quantity \(u(t,x)\) transported at a constant positive speed \(a > 0\), subject to the initial condition \(u(0,x) = u_0(x)\).

The exact solution to \eqref{eq:linadv} is
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:linadv-exact-sol}
    u(t,x) = u_0(x - a t).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reconstruct-Evolve-Average Algorithm}
\label{sub:Reconstruct-Evolve-Average Algorithm}
Explicit finite volume schemes for solving \eqref{eq:linadv} can be derived
using the Reconstruct-Evolve-Average (REA) algorithm, a geometric framework
detailed extensively in \cite{1992_LeVeque_BOOK,2002_LeVeque_BOOK}. The method
was originally proposed by Godunov \cite{1959_Godunov} for solving the nonlinear
Euler equations of gas dynamics.

\paragraph*{The REA Algorithm}
\label{par:REA}
Let \(u_i^n\) denote the cell average over the \(i\)-th cell at time \(t_n\). The update to \(t_{n+1} = t_n + \Delta t\) proceeds in three steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Reconstruct:} Construct a global piecewise polynomial function \(\tilde{u}^{n}(x,t_n)\) defined for all \(x\) from the set of discrete cell averages \(\{u_i^n\}\).

    \item \textbf{Evolve:} Solve \eqref{eq:linadv} exactly with \(\tilde{u}^{n}(x,t_n)\) as the initial data to obtain the evolved solution at the next time level:
    \[ \tilde{u}(x, t_{n+1}) = \tilde{u}^n(x - a\Delta t, t_n). \]

    \item \textbf{Average:} Compute the new cell averages by integrating the evolved function over each grid cell:
    \begin{equation}
        \label{eq:rea-average}
        u_{i}^{n+1} = \frac{1}{\Delta x} \int_{x_{i - 1/2}}^{x_{i + 1/2}} \tilde{u}(x,t_{n+1}) \,\mathrm{d}x.
    \end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example: The First-Order Godunov Scheme}%
\label{sub:Example: The First-Order Godunov Scheme}

To illustrate this procedure, we apply the REA algorithm to the simplest case: a piecewise constant reconstruction.

\textbf{1. Reconstruct:} 
We define the function \(\tilde{u}^n(x, t_n)\) to be constant within each cell, taking the value of the cell average:
\[
    \tilde{u}^{n}(x,t_{n}) = u_{i}^{n} \quad \text{for } x \in [x_{i-1/2}, x_{i+1/2}).
\]
This produces a "staircase" profile representing the solution.

\textbf{2. Evolve:} 
We evolve this profile exactly over one time step \(\Delta t\). Geometrically, the entire staircase shifts to the right by a distance \(a\Delta t\). Assuming the CFL condition \(a\Delta t \leq \Delta x\), the solution at the interface \(x_{i-1/2}\) is determined by the value of the cell to the left, \(u_{i-1}^n\).

\textbf{3. Average:}
Computing the new cell average by directly integrating the evolved profile
\(\tilde{u}\) is mathematically equivalent to a flux-based update. The change in the total conserved quantity within cell \(i\) corresponds precisely to the geometric area of the solution profile "swept" across the cell boundaries during the time step \(\Delta t\).

The total quantity entering the cell across the left interface \(x_{i-1/2}\) is the width of the shift multiplied by the height of the reconstructed function in the upwind cell:
\[
    \text{Inflow} = (a \Delta t) \cdot u_{i-1}^n.
\]
Similarly, the quantity leaving the cell across the right interface \(x_{i+1/2}\) is:
\[
    \text{Outflow} = (a \Delta t) \cdot u_{i}^n.
\]
Dividing these values by \(\Delta t\) yields the numerical fluxes \(F_{i-1/2} = a u_{i-1}^n\) and \(F_{i+1/2} = a u_{i}^n\). Substituting these into the standard conservation form \eqref{eq:fvm_general} recovers the classical explicit upwind scheme:
\[
    u_i^{n+1} = u_i^n - \frac{a \Delta t}{\Delta x} (u_i^n - u_{i-1}^n).
\]

The order of accuracy and stability of the resulting scheme depend entirely on the choice of the reconstruction \(\tilde{u}^{n}(x,t_n)\).
For instance, the first-order Godunov scheme is obtained via a piecewise constant reconstruction:
\[
    \tilde{u}^{n}(x,t_{n}) = u_{i}^{n} \quad \text{for } x \in [x_{i-1/2},
    x_{i+1/2}),
\]
where the constant value is the cell average.

While this explicit formulation yields a stable scheme under the CFL condition $\nu \leq 1$,
our goal in Chapter X is to relax this restriction...

To obtain a second-order scheme, one might consider a piecewise linear
reconstruction with slopes \(\sigma_{i}\) in each cell. For a third-order
scheme, we choose a piecewise-parabolic reconstruction and so on.
Generally, to obtain an \(n\)-th order scheme we need an \((n-1)\)-th
order polynomial reconstruction.

The limitation of explicit methods is the small time step.
