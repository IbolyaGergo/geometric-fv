\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis presents a geometric framework for constructing high-order accurate,
semi-implicit finite volume methods for the linear advection equation.
By extending the classical wave-propagation algorithms - standard in explicit
schemes - we derive fully discrete high-order approximations adapted
for semi-implicit time discretization.
This methodology preserves the intuitive structure of explicit schemes
while offering the stability benefits of semi-implicit formulations.
Crucially, this approach allows for the straightforward extension of limiting
techniques. We demonstrate that limiters can be constructed analogously to the
explicit case to ensure the resulting semi-implicit schemes strictly satisfy the
discrete maximum principle.
