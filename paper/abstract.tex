\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis presents a geometric framework for constructing high-order accurate,
implicit finite volume methods for the linear advection equation.
By extending the classical wave-propagation algorithms - standard in explicit
schemes - we derive fully discrete high-order approximations adapted
for implicit time discretization.
This methodology preserves the intuitive structure of explicit schemes
while offering the stability benefits of implicit formulations.
Crucially, this approach allows for the straightforward extension of limiting
techniques. We demonstrate that limiters can be constructed analogously to the
explicit case to ensure the resulting implicit schemes strictly satisfy the
discrete maximum principle.
